Paper
============
- Put \notes into footnotes
- tons of see defs in section 2
- Figure 6 is never actually referenced
- Fig 6.c. is wonky
    - bodypin-drp.eps has one line that's too long
- Grants... funding?

Elsevier Paper
========
- Figure out what last steps need to be taken
- Check for final corrections that need to be made
    - Redefine DRP (clarity), CanDRP, and OptDRP (tree -> forest)

Revision 3
============
- p16 "qusecs' " -> "qusecs"
- p16 Definition 15 rewording
- p17 "i.e.,"
- p17 Def 19 -> "sub-graph"
- p17 Rem 24 -> commas around parantheses
- p18 Pinned line -> put in def environment
- p19 remove "Note:"
- Maybe redo k33 figs to match style and not flip things around

============
- Algorithm complexity is difficult to understand. Frontier runs at most O(V) times. MAybe don't even mention Frontier (or just explain)
- say we can get the true canonical plan form the end result (sequential)
- add in edge if it doesn't addin with frontier to any of the candidtates



============
I need to prove that you can just add in the edges... I'm pretty sure those will all be wcvmps of the subgraph Ri, but it's not proven...
