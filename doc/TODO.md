Paper
============
- Better title for section 4
- Unify capitalization scheme for (sub)sections

New intro
=========
- paragraph on decomp
- on recomb
- on materials and suitability of the other two to these qusecs (introduce them... why do we need this term?)
- make it clear in intro that beginning is all bar-joint (one type of qusecs). Then we'll use other kinds of constraint systems falling under the umbrella of qusecs to model two types of materials
- org and contribs


- Put prev work into respective sections
- First two paragraphs of importance of drp can be incorporated into intro
- Problems relationships goes into recomb


Issues
=========
- Intro and org sections seem kind of redundant
- Footnotes?
- 3.1 and 4.1 - Previous works, space between paragraphs
- Joel's figure, long line
- Consistent capitalization of section titles



Minutes
=========
- intro:
    - first 2 sentences should contain everything the paper is about, the essence, layout the scenario, the challenges, the motivation.
      - "Geometric constraint systems are used everywhere... a few have sparsity conditions... self similarity and quasi uniformity... these are the main problems left in this area..."
    - Next 2 should roughly cover what our contribution is.
    - break into subsections (decomp, recomb, qusecs)
    - qusecs def: find that sentence about "We use the standard way of dealing w/ these problems, namely modeling it as a geometric constraint system..."
    - Close with: "Concerning these issue... this is what we do in relation to them... the specifics we address.." and go into summary of our contributions
- in other sections:
    - begin with small intro
    - prelim should come before defs if the defs aren't needed
    - then go into our work
- Appendices: move them back in, determine which defs are still needed.


Questions for Meera
============
- Abstract:
    - Made some minor suggested changes to the intro.
- Section: Intro:
    - Please proof read all of it. It's definitely a little rough right now, but most importantly is the organization and overall structure good?
    - I'm having difficulty nailing down the first paragraph. I'm trying to do what you suggested, however the somewhat disjoint topics covered in the paper make it difficult. I can't figure out how to smoothly cover the field and problems then move on to what we do in the paper to address them. Right now it's problem->answer->problem->answer->problem->answer (for DR-planning, indecomposable systems, qusecs).
- Section: Prelim:
    - Moved all definitions back in. Are all of the definitions still needed?
    - Moved stuff about inequalities into a separate short paragraph instead of parenthetical asides.
- Section: DRP:
    - Moved the definition of CanDRP from 3.1 into the introductory paragraphs. Does this work?
    - Should the theorems in this section specify independent bar-joint 2d, despite mentioning it in the introduction to the section?
    - I changed the proof for the CanDRP algorithm, is it more clear written this way?
- Section: DRP and Recomb:
    - Moved the previous work in.
- Appendix: Proofs:
    - Just want to ask one more time, should these actually be moved in? This is what you asked for, but I feel like it clutters up the paper and aren't really the focus in their sections. The proofs aren't all that interesting (unlike the ones that are currently in). If you still think so, I'll move them all in for the next draft.









Mention bodypin

I need to prove that you can just add in the edges... I'm pretty sure those will all be wcvmps of the subgraph Ri, but it's not proven...






CAGD Paper:
    - Add highlights
    - Change keywords?
    - Get rid of theorem defs that came from GMP2015.cls
    - Put \notes into footnotes?


    - Figure 6 is never actually referenced
    - Fig 6.c. is wonky
        - bodypin-drp.eps has one line that's too long

    -tons of see defs in section 2

    - MFA conjecture... should it be in open problems?

    -Proof of Theorem \ref{theorem:criterionc}: random minus sign?

    - In sec:DRP, should the remark and lemma be put in the proof and the one line eliminated?

    - Grants... funding?
