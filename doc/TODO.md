Paper
============
- tons of see defs in section 2
- Figure 6 is never actually referenced
- Fig 6.c. is wonky
    - bodypin-drp.eps has one line that's too long
- Grants... funding?



Still Want to Change
=============
- Point out that the plan contains the minimal and maximal subgraphs (NP-hard to find in general)



============
I need to prove that you can just add in the edges... I'm pretty sure those will all be wcvmps of the subgraph Ri, but it's not proven...
