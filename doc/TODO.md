Major changes for v3
=============
- p5: DR-plan defs (split them up and reworded 1)
- p6: Canonical DR-plan (new def)
- p9: Algorithm: Split into 2 theorems and reworded theorem/proof
- p17: Body-hyperpin (reworded def)
- p18: Pinned line-incidence (put in def environment)




Paper
============
- Put \notes into footnotes
- tons of see defs in section 2
- Figure 6 is never actually referenced
- Fig 6.c. is wonky
    - bodypin-drp.eps has one line that's too long
- Grants... funding?

Elsevier Paper
========
- Figure out what last steps need to be taken
- Check for final corrections that need to be made
    - Redefine DRP (clarity), CanDRP, and OptDRP (tree -> forest)




Tibor
============
- Algorithm complexity is difficult to understand. Frontier runs at most O(V) times. MAybe don't even mention Frontier (or just explain)


Still Want to Change
=============
- Maybe redo k33 figs to match style of earlier figs and not flip vertices around
- Point out that the plan contains the minimal and maximal subgraphs (NP-hard to find in general)
- Conjecture 31: O(n^3)



============
I need to prove that you can just add in the edges... I'm pretty sure those will all be wcvmps of the subgraph Ri, but it's not proven...
