A variety of quasi-uniform (aperiodic) and possibly self-similar, layered material structures are natural consequences of the design objectives of rigidity and flexibility, minimizing mass, optimally distributing external stresses, and participating in assembly of diverse and multifunctional, larger structures.

Crucial for design and analysis of these properties is the recursive decomposition of diverse types of underlying isostatic or underconstrained 2D geometric constraint systems (which we collectively call \textit{qusecs}). While the optimal recursive decomposition (\textit{DR-planning}) problem is NP-hard even for 2D bar-joint constraint systems, we describe an $O(n^2)$ algorithm  for qusecs. Besides elucidating the source of NP-hardness, the algorithm outputs \textit{canonical} DR-plans that meet previously studied desirable criteria. When a DR-plan is input, we show reductions between problems related to realizing qusecs,  leading to efficient algorithms that leverage recent results on Cayley configuration spaces. We briefly discuss two specific 2D layered materials as applications of the above algorithms, whose software implementation is available.

% We give an efficient ($O(n^2)$) algorithm to find a canonical (and hence

% explore connected components of the configuration space of
% underconstrained 2D qusecs.
