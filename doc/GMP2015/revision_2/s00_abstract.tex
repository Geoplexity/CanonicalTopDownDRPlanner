\begin{abstract}
Optimal recursive decomposition (or \dfn{DR-planning}) is crucial for analyzing, designing, solving or finding realizations of geometric constraint sytems. While the optimal DR-planning problem is NP-hard even for general 2D bar-joint constraint systems, we describe an \candrpcomplexity\ algorithm for \cutout{qusecs} \addin{a broad class of constraint systems} that are   isostatic or underconstrained. The algorithm \cutout{relies on} \addin{achieves optimality by using} the new notion of a canonical DR-plan that \addin{also} meets various desirable, previously studied criteria. In addition, we leverage recent results on Cayley configuration spaces to show that the indecomposable systems---that are solved at the nodes of the optimal DR-plan by recombining solutions to child systems---can be minimally modified to become decomposable and have a small DR-plan, leading to efficient realization algorithms. We show formal connections to well-known problems such as completion of underconstrained systems.

% A variety of quasi-uniform (aperiodic) and possibly self-similar, layered material structures are natural consequences of the design objectives of rigidity and flexibility, minimizing mass, optimally distributing external stresses, and participating in assembly of diverse and multifunctional, larger structures.

% Crucial for design and analysis of these properties is the recursive decomposition of diverse types of underlying isostatic or underconstrained 2D geometric constraint systems (which we collectively call \textit{qusecs}). While the optimal recursive decomposition (\textit{DR-planning}) problem is NP-hard even for 2D bar-joint constraint systems, we describe an $O(n^2)$ algorithm  for qusecs. Besides elucidating the source of NP-hardness, the algorithm outputs \textit{canonical} DR-plans that meet previously studied desirable criteria. When a DR-plan is input, we show reductions between problems related to realizing qusecs,  leading to efficient algorithms that leverage recent results on Cayley configuration spaces. We briefly discuss two specific 2D layered materials as applications of the above algorithms, whose software implementation is available.
