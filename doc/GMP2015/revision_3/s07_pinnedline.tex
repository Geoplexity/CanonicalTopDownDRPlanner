\section{Application: Finding Optimal DR-Plans and Realizations for Cross-Linking Microfibrils }
\label{sec:pinnedline}

The canonical DR-plan of Section \ref{sec:DRP} can additionally be applied to analyze and solve the structure of cross-linking collagen microfibrils in animals, cellulose microfibrils in plant cell walls, and actin filaments in the cytoskeleton by modeling these structures as a third type of qusecs, \dfn{pinned line-incidence systems}.


\dfn{Collagen} is an important protein material in biological tissues with highly elastic mechanical properties \cite{buehler2008nanomechanics}. \dfn{Cellulose} is the most important constituent of the cell wall of plants (see Figure~\ref{fig:cellulose}) \cite{fall2013physical,smith1971plant}. Both of these substances consist of a large number \dfn{microfibrils},
%fibril itself straight?
%Each fibril is attached to some fixed larger organelle/membrane at one spot (typically on the boundary).
%It is additionally
each of which is cross-linked at 2 places with usually 3 other fibrils, where the \dfn{cross-linking} is like an incidence constraint that the crosslinked fibrils can slide against each other while remaining incident (see Figure~\ref{fig:crosslink}).

\subsection{Modeling the Fibrils as a Pinned Line-Incidence System}



The cross-linking microfibrils can be modeled as a pinned line-incidence constraint system in $\mathbb{R}^2$, where incidence constraints are used instead of distance constraints.

\begin{definition}
    A \dfn{pinned line-incidence system} $(G,\delta)$ is a graph $G=(V,E)$ together with parameters $\delta$ specifying $|E|$ \dfn{pins} with fixed positions in $\mathbb{R}^2$, such that each edge is constrained to lie on a line passing through the corresponding pin, i.e.\ $\delta: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$.
\end{definition}


%
% $G=(V,E, w_V, w_E)$
%%is a \textbf{2-dimensional pinned line-incidence graph},
% has weight functions $w_V(v) = 2, w_E(e) = 1$ for all $v \in V, e \in E$.
%Additionally, there is  a  set $X$ of $|E|$ \textbf{pins} with fixed positions in $\mathbb{R}^2$,
%such that  %every edge $e \in E$ corresponds to a pin $x \in X$ where
%for each edge $e \in E$, there is a uniquely corresponding pin $x \in X$,
%such that $e$ is constrained to lie on a line passing through $x$.
%%There exists a set $X$ of $|E|$ pins fixed in $\mathbb{R}^2$, such that each edge $e_i$
%
A pinned line-incidence graph $G$ is rigid if $|E| = 2|V|$ and $|E'| \le 2|V'|$ for every induced subgraph $(V',E')$ \cite{sitharam2014incidence}. Note that no trivial motion exists since the pins have fixed positions on the plane. Euclidean transformations are not factored out. In particular, both a single vertex and a single edge are underconstrained graphs.




In the case of microfibril cross-linking, each fibril is attached to some fixed larger organelle/membrane at one site. Consequently, each fibril can be modeled as an edge of the graph, with the attachment being the corresponding pin. The two cross-linkings in which the fibril participates are modeled as the two vertices in $V$ defining the edge.



Figure~\ref{fig:pinned_line} shows an example of a pinned line-incidence graph, where the grey ovals denote pins representing attachments of fibrils, and the vertices $a_1,a_2,\ldots, c_3$ represent cross-linkings.
% and the black dots stand for vertices/cross-linkings.
%There are  and 10 vertices/cross-linkings in the graph.
The graph is isostatic, with 12 vertices and 24 edges/pins.

\subsection{Optimal DR-Plan for Pinned Line-Incidence Systems}

%Recall the definitions in Section~\ref{priliminary}.

In this section, we will adapt the results in Section~\ref{sec:DRP} to give the canonical DR-plan for pinned line-incidence graphs. First, we note that
%unlike bar-joint graphs,
\vemph{an isostatic pinned line-incidence graph can be disconnected}, being the disjoint union of two or more isostatic subgraphs. This is because the pins have fixed positions on the plane.
%
%the following difference of pinned line-incidence graphs from the bar-joint graphs.
%
%For pinned line-incidence graphs,
%since the pins have fixed positions on the plane,
%{\em a wellconstrained vertex-maximal proper subgraph can be disconnected},
%being the disjoint union of two or more wellconstrained subgraphs.
%
%\begin{itemize}
%
%\item For pinned line-incidence graphs,
%since the pins have fixed positions on the plane,
%no trivial motion exists, therefore {\em no trivial overconstrained graphs exist} (the smallest overconstrained graph has $6$ vertices).\\
%In particular, note that both a single vertex and a single edge are underconstrained graphs.
%
%\item
%For pinned line-incidence graphs,
%since the pins have fixed positions on the plane,
%{\em a wellconstrained vertex-maximal proper subgraph can be disconnected},
%being the disjoint union of two or more wellconstrained subgraphs. \\
%%Without loss of generality,
%%we slightly modify the requirement of DR-plan for pinned line-incidence graphs
%%such that only connected subgraphs can be considered as a node of the DR-plan.
%
%\end{itemize}
%
We define a \dfn{trivial} graph to be a single vertex and make the following modification to the definition of the canonical DR-plan:

%\begin{itemize}
%\item For any $C$, its $N$ children, $C_1, \ldots, C_N$, are {\em edges} or {\em connected} wellconstrained vertex-maximal proper subgraphs of that node $C$.
%\item A node containing a single edge is a leaf.
%%\item
%%\todo{We just define the %trivial graph/
%%DR-plan leaves for 2-dimensional pinned line-incidence graphs to be single vertices...  }
%%\item \todo{A single edge can be a node of the DR-plan}
%%\item only connected subgraphs can be considered as a node of the DR-plan.
%\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}
    The \dfn{DR-plan} of a  pinned line-incidence graph $G$ is one in which (1) each child node of a non-leaf node $C$ is either a \dfn{connected} rigid vertex-induced subgraph of $C$, or an edge not contained in any  proper rigid subgraph of $C$, and (2) a leaf node is a single edge.
    % Definition~\ref{def:drp} with  modified rules number 2 and 4:
    %    The \textbf{decomposition-recombination (DR-) plan} of  a 2-dimensional pinned line-incidence graph $G$, $DRP(G)$, is  a tree that has the following properties:
    %    \begin{enumerate}
    %        %\item The root of the tree `contains' $G$.
    %        \item[2] For any non-leaf node $C$, each of its children, $C_1,\ldots,C_N$, is either an edge not contained in any wellconstrained proper subgraph of $C$, or a {\em connected} wellconstrained vertex-maximal proper subgraph of  $C$.
    %        %\item The vertex set of $\bigcup_{i=1}^N{C_i}$ is the vertex set of $C$.
    %        \item[4] A node containing a single edge is a leaf.
    %    \end{enumerate}

    The \dfn{canonical DR-plan}  of $G$  is one in which the  child rigid subgraphs are connected, isostatic vertex-maximal subgraphs of the parent.
\end{definition}


Theorem~\ref{theorem:main} holds for pinned line-incidence graphs with this modified definition. The proof is similar to the original proof (in Section~\ref{sec:DRP}) using the same set of lemmas and
%
%\begin{corollary}\label{cor:pinned}
%Given a isostatic pinned line-incidence graph, for node $C$ in $OptimalDRP(G)$ and the children of $C$ in $CompleteDRP(C)$ labeled as $C_1,\ldots,C_N$
%\begin{enumerate}
%    \item if $C_i \cap C_j$ is trivial then all $C_1,\ldots,C_N$ are children of $C$ in $OptimalDRP(G)$.
%    \item if $C_i \cap C_j$ is isostatic then any two out of $C_1,\ldots,C_N$ will be the only children of $C$ in $OptimalDRP(G)$.
%\end{enumerate}
%\end{corollary}
%
the following modified version of Observation~\ref{lemma:union_intersection},
% observation, which
%serves a similar function to Observation~\ref{lemma:union_intersection} in Section~\ref{sec:DRP}
%Using similar counting-based argument, %  to Lemma~\ref{t-l1}--\ref{iuc-l1} in Section~\ref{sec:union_intersection},
which  can be proved using a simple counting based argument.


\begin{observation}\label{lem:pinned_union_intersection}
    Let $F_i$ and $F_j$ to be subgraphs of the same isostatic graph $F$, where each of them can be either a single edge or a connected isostatic subgraph. There are only two possible cases:
    (1) at least one of $F_i$, $F_j$ is an edge, if and only if $F_i \cup F_j$ is underconstrained, if and only if $F_i \cap F_j$ is trivial; and (2) both $F_i$ and $F_j$ are isostatic, if and only if $F_i \cup F_j$ is isostatic, if and only if $F_i \cap F_j$ is isostatic.

    %\end{tabular}
    %\end{center}
    %}
    %\setlength{\tabcolsep}{6pt}
\end{observation}

Given Observation~\ref{lem:pinned_union_intersection}, % and the modified definition of DR-plan,
Lemma \ref{lemma:combined_lemma}, Point \ref{lemma:wc_intersection_is_C} and \ref{lemma:uc_intersection_makes_all_uc}, straightforwardly extend to pinned line-incidence graphs. The proof of Point~\ref{lemma:wc_intersection_makes_all_wc} for pinned line-incidence graphs is given in~\ref{sec:appendix_pinned}.
%The following lemma serves as Lemma~ for pinned line-incidence and can be proved similarly.
%\begin{lemma}
%\label{lem:vertex_intersection}
%If $C_i\cap C_j$ is a single vertex, then $\forall k: C_i\cap C_k$ is a single vertex.
%\end{lemma}
%Given Lemma~\ref{lemma:wc_intersection_makes_all_wc} and Lemma~\ref{lemma:uc_intersection_makes_all_uc},
Thus it is straightforward to adapt the proof of Theorem~\ref{theorem:main} to  pinned line-incidence graphs.
%thus proving Corollary~\ref{cor:pinned}.
%
Consequently, we can efficiently find the optimal DR-plan for  pinned line-incidence graphs using basically the same algorithm as for  bar-joint graphs.

% \sidenote{
Note that the recombination problem for pinned line-incidence systems is trivial. Since the pins are given fixed positions in the plane, the solutions of an isostatic subsystem will automatically be consistent with the solutions of the other subsystems.
