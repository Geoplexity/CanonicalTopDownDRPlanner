GUI
============
- Zoom is weird, zooms in on (0,0)
- Put a line over my thick line, just to be safe

Build
============
- Circle should be broken up
- windows in main should be pulled out itno separate files
- should make cpp files for some header only things (like circle, easyfont, etc)

Pebble game
============
- Doesn't check if the same edge is entered twice (same direction or reversed)

Known bugs
============
- Run square edges triangle and press space... usually crashes

Features to add
============
- Color code clicking
- Decomposition as explained in the paper
- Recombination








Mention bodypin

I need to prove that you can just add in the edges... I'm pretty sure those will all be wcvmps of the subgraph Ri, but it's not proven...






CAGD Paper:
    - Add highlights
    - Change keywords?
    - Get rid of theorem defs that came from GMP2015.cls
    - Put \notes into footnotes?


    - Figure 6 is never actually referenced
    - Fig 6.c. is wonky
        - bodypin-drp.eps has one line that's too long

    -tons of see defs in section 2

    - MFA conjecture... should it be in open problems?

    -Proof of Theorem \ref{theorem:criterionc}: random minus sign?

    - In sec:DRP, should the remark and lemma be put in the proof and the one line eliminated?

    - Grants... funding?



Overall, the contributions of this paper are significant to be considered for publication. The authors demonstrate the claims in section 1.2, in the paper. The figures are explanatory, but need a little more work (see the specific comments below). However, the text is not clear and hard to follow thus, requires modification before the publication. More specific comments are given below.

Comments:

- 1       Abstract is not clear and fails to give the idea described in the text. I can understand the presented idea when I read the paper but abstract should give an idea about what has been done in the paper more clearly.
- 2       Section 1: The goal and brief description of the proposed method need to be explained before section 1.1. Otherwise, it is hard to distinguish the work presented here from the ones in the literature.
- 3       Figure 1 needs to be re-arranged. Keep the explanations for (a), (b) and (c) subfigures in the caption. The images should be arranged to have same height. Currently, they look as if copy-pasted hastily. Figure 1(c) there are (A,B,C,D,E) in the image, which create confusion. Those should be eliminated since they are the sub figure letters for the paper this was taken from.
- 4       Figure 2, figure 3, and figure 6: have the sub figure numbers align with each other. Again, the current offset is too much and makes it look like these are created in a hurry with not much attention.
- 5       There are multiple grammar/spelling, lower/upper case use mistakes in the text and needs to be corrected. Examples include:
o 5a      Section 1.1.(ii): “An optimal DR-plan is one that minimizes the size (defined formally in Section 2, …”
o 5b      Section 1.2. - #4: “For Examples 1, 2 (achieving isostaticity, distribution …”
o 5c      Section 1.2 : “Note: All proofs appear in the Appendix (submitted an a …“
- 6       Section 2: It can be shortened given the fact that most of the information here can be referred from the literature or moved to the appendix.
- 7       Section 3:  Given the fact that efficiency of the proposed method is one of the contributions (contributions #2), more detailed explanation of Theorem 8 is required in the text rather than appendix. Replacing significant part of Section 2 with the proof of theorem 8 in appendix would be a nice modification for clarification.
- 10      The future work needs to be moved to the main paper, currently it is in the supplemental material.
- 11      There are some minor english problems, but a lot of typos which need to be eliminated. (To name a few: - in the note right before section 2: ... submitted an a permitted ... >> ... submitted as a permitted ..., Abstract: ... DR- plans ... >> ... DR-plans ...) In general there is inconsistency in the use of ``-''. There should be no spaces between a hyphen and the two words. I suggest the authors to give a final careful read primarily for typos and correct them.




- 8       Theory of the presented method is explained in detail, however there is significant work that shows the advantages of the presented method over the ones available in the literature. A detailed performance comparison for the mentioned common examples would improve the paper.
- 9       A figure that explains to overall approach must be added in the Introduction section. More generally, I recommend authors to modify the general flow of the paper to make more understandable.
